# About
- Learn how to write clean, optimized python code
- Learn about the Python Programming Language


# Week 1 and 2 Final Project

<h3>Prize</h3>

- Whoever develops the best program will win 20$
- I will be using a point system to determine the winner..
- This means that if you're code does not follow project requirements or the code is messy, slow and unorganized, you will lose points.


<h3>Project Must Include</h3>

- Minimum of 1 class
- Minimum of 1 user input
- Minimum of 1 list or dictionary variable
- Minimum of 3 statements (if, elif, else)
- Minimum of 2 for loops and 1 while loop
- Minimum of 1 import (random, string, doesn't matter)
- Minimum of 3 functions (lambda or basic), (1 requires parameters), (1 returns value)


<h3>Syntax Requirements</h3>

- All of the above inclusions must use the Advanced syntax. Examples shoen below

```py

# // Variables
my_list: list[str] = ['a', 1, 0.1]
